Notice changes in the `BinaryTreeNode` that the `value` with a generic type `V` is added.

Correct the `add()` method in `BinarySearchTree` per those changes, 
so the value should be assigned to the node while creating a new one.

*Remarks: we, again, cannot verify for its correctness at this point.*
